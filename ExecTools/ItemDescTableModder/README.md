## 📦 How to Use

<img src="Misc/Doc/how-to-use.gif" width="100%" />

1. **Make a backup of your current `itemInfo_EN.lua` file**, just in case you want to restore it later.  
   _(Usually found in `RagnarokFolder/System`.)_
2. Drag and drop the original `itemInfo_EN.lua` file onto the `ItemDescTableModder` program.  
   _(Simply drag the file onto the tool’s icon.)_
3. The tool will generate a new **System** folder containing the updated `itemInfo_EN.lua`.
4. Copy the new **System** folder into your **Ragnarok Online** game directory.
5. If you're asked to overwrite files, click **Yes**.

✅ That’s it! Launch the game and enjoy the updated item descriptions.

## 🛡️ Tips & Reminders

- **Always back up** your original `.lua` files before making any changes.
- If something breaks or looks wrong in-game, try restoring the backup or **re-downloading patches** using your game patcher to fix it.
- **Note:** Future game patches may **automatically overwrite** your modified `.lua` files. If that happens, just run this tool again to reapply the changes.
